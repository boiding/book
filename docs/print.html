<p>An exploration in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">Boids</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what to expect" id="what to expect"><h1>What to expect</h1></a>
<p>This book is used during the <em>Boiding</em> workshop. I allows you explore to
<a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/">Craig Reynold's</a> <em>boids</em> that simulate flocking
behavior of animals such as fish and birds.</p>
<p>But this is not a passive workshop. You get to explore the simulation by
building it! We provide you with the background to understand the algorithm and
a platform to explore the algorithm.</p>
<p>You will be implementing the brain of your own species of boids and seeing them
flock on the big screen.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#background" id="background"><h1>Background</h1></a>
<p>In the following sections we will learn about the concepts behind <em>Boids</em> as
introduced by Craig Reynolds. It will create a conceptual background that aids
us in implementing the algorithm.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#boid" id="boid"><h1>Boid</h1></a>
<p>A <em>boid</em> is a virtual creatures, much like a bird or a fish. You should get
attached to it, because we are going to spend a lot of time with them. We are
going to teach it how to move gracefully among their siblings.</p>
<p>You might not know it, but you have probably seen our friend before. If you are
familiar with movies like <em>The Lion King</em> or <em>Batman returns</em>, you have seen
boids before. In The Lion King the stampede of wildebeests was created with a
boid algorithm. The bats and also penguins were similar modeled in Batman
returns.</p>
<p>Although the original boids moved in a three dimensional world, to keep things
simple we are going to restrict the movement of our boids to two dimensions.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#characteristics" id="characteristics"><h2>Characteristics</h2></a>
<p>In this section we will provide an high level overview of the characteristics of
our boid. These pertain to the simulation we are going to before, but feel free
to attribute other characteristics.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#primary" id="primary"><h3>Primary</h3></a>
<p>The primary characteristics are the characteristics that one can measure. You
can find them below.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#position" id="position"><h4>Position</h4></a>
<p>Maybe the most striking characteristic is the boids <em>position</em>. It keeps track
of where the boid is. We describe it by two projects, i.e. the <em>x</em> coordinate
and the <em>y</em> coordinate.</p>
<p>The world that the boids occupy wraps around on it self. This means that it
doesn't have edges. If a boid moves off the right side of the world it enters on
the left side of the world and vice versa. Similar for the top and bottom of the
world.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#heading" id="heading"><h4>Heading</h4></a>
<p>An other characteristic of a boid is its <em>heading</em>, i.e. The angle it is
pointing in. These angles are measured in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian">radians</a> and have a range of
\(-\pi\) to \(+\pi\). When the boid is pointing to the right she has a
heading of 0.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#speed" id="speed"><h4>Speed</h4></a>
<p>The <em>speed</em> measures how fast the boid is going. Together with the heading this
makes up the velocity.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#secondary" id="secondary"><h3>Secondary</h3></a>
<p>The secondary characteristics are used in the simulation, but are less apparent
than the primary characteristic.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#intended heading" id="intended heading"><h4>Intended Heading</h4></a>
<p>This is the heading your boid would like to have. It could differ from the
primary heading and is used to steer the boid in order to avoid collisions or
signal preferred direction.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#intended speed" id="intended speed"><h4>Intended Speed</h4></a>
<p>Like the intended heading, this is the speed the boid would want to move in.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#agility" id="agility"><h4>Agility</h4></a>
<p>The <em>agility</em> determines how quickly the boid can go from the primary heading
and primary speed, i.e. the primary velocity, to the intended heading and
intended speed. Changing course takes times and that is reflected in this value.
It ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 represents a total <em>inability</em> to change velocity
and 1 represents the ability to instantly change course.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#influence sphere" id="influence sphere"><h4>Influence Sphere</h4></a>
<p>This is the area in which other boids are sensed an as a result interacted with.
It is a circle centered at the position of the boid and measured by a radius.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#separation" id="separation"><h1>Separation</h1></a>
<p><img src="image/separation.gif" alt="Separation; steering clear of budding boids" /></p>
<p>One of the classic motivations for our boid is <em>separation</em>. Steer clear from
your budding boids to minimize the chances of collisions.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#alignment" id="alignment"><h1>Alignment</h1></a>
<p><img src="image/alignment.gif" alt="Try to fly in the same average heading of your cohort" /></p>
<p>Aligning yourself in the average heading of your cohort is an other motivation.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#cohesion" id="cohesion"><h1>Cohesion</h1></a>
<p><img src="image/cohesion.gif" alt="Surrounding yourself with budding boids increases survival chances." /></p>
<p>Predators attack on the outside of your cohort. It motivates boids to move to
the center of the flock.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#calculation" id="calculation"><h2>Calculation</h2></a>
<p>Let the position of our boids be given by a sequence of coordinates
\(p_{1} = (x_{1}, y_{1}), p_{2} = (x_{2}, y_{2}), \ldots, p_{n} = (x_{n}, y_{n})\).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass"><em>center of mass</em></a> is
calculated by averaging the positions. This assumes that the boids all weigh the
same. Since our boids are virtual, we can mold them as we see fit.</p>
<p>The averaging can be done component-wise so the x-coordinate of the center of
mass can be calculated with</p>
<p>\[
x_{c} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}
\]</p>
<p>Likewise the y-coordinate of the center of mass isize</p>
<p>\[
y_{c} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}
\]</p>
<p>Together this gives \(p_{c} = (x_{c}, y_{c})\) for the center of mass.</p>
<p>Now that we know the center of mass, we would like to figure out the heading a
boid needs to fly in to head towards the center of mass. If the position of the
boid is \(p = (x, y)\), the direction to fly in is found by subtracting the
center of mass from the boid's position.</p>
<p>\[
d := p_{c} - p = (x_{c} - x, y_{c} - y)
\]</p>
<p>We can calculate the heading from this by taking the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions"><em>arctangent</em></a>
; \(\operatorname{atan}(\frac{y_{c} - y}{x_{c} - x})\)</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#plan" id="plan"><h1>Plan</h1></a>
<p>We will go over the high level plan for this workshop. We will detail all the
moving parts and how they interact.</p>
<p>We will ask you to team up. Working in pairs has the added benefit that you can
learn from each other. Your team is responsible for creating a web server that
has the responsibility to answer the question what your boid wants to do. You
will register your web server to the workshop server. The workshop server is
responsible for coordinating the boids brains (your web servers) and the boids
behavior (the simulation).</p>
<p>If this sounds daunting, relax. We went to great lengths to make this a joyous,
interesting and stimulating workshop.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#wlan" id="wlan"><h2>WLAN</h2></a>
<p>We setup a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) so that the computer participating
in the workshop can find each other without a trouble. Look for a network with
the following credentials</p>
<ul>
<li>SSID: <strong>boiding_workshop</strong></li>
<li>password: <strong>2boid||!2boid</strong></li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#starter kits" id="starter kits"><h2>Starter Kits</h2></a>
<p>We prepared starter kits in various languages. You can find them in the workshop
material. Copy the starter of your choice and get ready to teaching your boids.</p>
<p>Your web server should listen on <strong>port 2643</strong> which spells <em>boid</em> on a phone's
keypad. Your starter kits already make this happen.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#register your server" id="register your server"><h2>Register Your Server</h2></a>
<p>The workshop server should be come aware of your web server. Each start kit has
a automated way to register itself. See the README in your starter kit how the
specific registration works.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#teach your boids" id="teach your boids"><h2>Teach Your Boids</h2></a>
<p>This is were you are able to shine. Teach your boids in a way you see fit. The
README in the starter kit of your choice will point you in the right direction.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#run the server" id="run the server"><h2>Run The Server</h2></a>
<p>Running your server allows your boids to roam free in their habitat and follow
the path you thought them to follow.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#web server" id="web server"><h1>Web Server</h1></a>
<p>In this chapter we will describe the web server that you will be creating. If
you are using a starter kit, most of what is described here is already taken
care of.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#responsibilities" id="responsibilities"><h1>Responsibilities</h1></a>
<p>Your web server has a couple of responsibilities. Besides forming the brain of
your boids, it also needs to convince the workshop server it is operating within
well established parameters.</p>
<p>A lot of things can go wrong. And we need to check for those. One of the things
that can go wrong is that your web server has stopped. Your web server must
respond to a heartbeat request so we know you server is still participating.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#heartbeat" id="heartbeat"><h2><code>/heartbeat</code></h2></a>
<p>The workshop server periodically will send a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD"><code>HEAD</code> request</a>
to your web server. It should respond with a
<a href="https://httpstatuses.com/204"><code>204</code></a> indicating a successful request without
content.
This will tell the workshop server your web server is still running.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#brain" id="brain"><h2><code>/brain</code></h2></a>
<p>The workshop server needs to know how your boids are going to react to their
environment. It will send a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST"><code>POST</code> request</a>
with your current flock as <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> data. Your web server
should figure out what each boid in your flock want to do and send their
decisions back as JSON.</p>
<p>The workshop server will take your response and integrate that in the simulation.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#representation" id="representation"><h1>Representation</h1></a>
<p>In this section we describe the <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> representation of
the data that is sent to your web server, as well as the representation that is
expected back.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#brain-1" id="brain-1"><h1>Brain</h1></a>
<p>In this chapter we will focus on developing the brain. There is no particular
order in which to develop the different parts of the brain. The background
chapter will be used as inspiration for the different parts of the brain.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#separation-1" id="separation-1"><h1>Separation</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#alignment-1" id="alignment-1"><h1>Alignment</h1></a>

<a class="header" href="print.html#material" id="material"><h1>Material</h1></a>
<p>If you find yourself at an actual boiding workshop the material for this
workshop is made available on a thumb drive. Grab one from the copy it to your
own machine.</p>
<p>The material was created with
<a href="https://github.com/boiding/material">material repository</a>. You should be able
to create your own workshop resources by cloning that repository and running the
<code>make</code> command.</p>
