# Background
In the following sections we will learn about the concepts behind [_Boids_][boids] as
introduced by [Craig Reynolds][reynolds]. It will create a conceptual background that aids
us in implementing the algorithm.

If math is not your cup of tea, don't worry. In the chapter on the brain of the
boid, we provide pseudo-code to illustrate the ideas in this chapter.

## Craig Reynolds

Craig Reynolds simulated the coordinate movement of birds in 1986 and coined the term _boids_
for these virtual creatures.

A very readable but extensive reference is Craig Reynolds own page on the [subject][origin].
