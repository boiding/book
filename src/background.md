# Background
In the following sections we will learn about the concepts behind _Boids_ as
introduced by Craig Reynolds. It will create a conceptual background that aids
us in implementing the algorithm.

If math is not your cup of tea, don't worry. In the chapter on the brain of the
boid, we provide pseudo-code to illustrate the ideas in this chapter.
