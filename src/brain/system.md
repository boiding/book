# System Check
You have created some boids, let's see if your brain can instruct them!

Each starter kit has has a central place where you can control the boids 
intentions. See the corresponding README where to find this place.

To familiarize yourself with the API and code, respond with an intent of

```json
{
    "heading": 0.0,
    "speed": 0.0
}
```

This should slowly stop the boids in their tracks and have them head due east.
