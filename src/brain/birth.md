# Birth
Before you can control some boids they first need to spring forth.
This can be done by pressing the "add boids" button next to your team name.

Boids are born from the chaos and will head in random directions. It is your job
to calm them and accept them into the flock.

## Note
Depending on your starter kit, and if you already starter your brain server, the
boids could settle down quickly. Be prepared for that.
