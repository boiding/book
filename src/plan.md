# Plan
We will go over the high level plan for this workshop. We will detail all the
moving parts and how they interact.

We will ask you to team up. Working in pairs has the added benefit that you can
learn from each other. Your team is responsible for creating a web server that
has the responsibility to answer the question what your boid wants to do. You
will register your web server to the workshop server. The workshop server is
responsible for coordinating the boids brains (your web servers) and the boids
behavior (the simulation).

If this sounds daunting, relax. We went to great lengths to make this a joyous,
interesting and stimulating workshop.

## WLAN
We setup a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) so that the computers participating
in the workshop can find each other without trouble. Look for a network with
the following credentials

* SSID: **boiding_workshop**
* password: **2boid||!2boid**

## Starter Kits
We prepared starter kits in various languages. You can find them in the workshop
material. Copy the starter of your choice and get ready to teaching your boids.

Your web server should listen on **port 2643** which spells _boid_ on a phone's
keypad. Your starter kits already make this happen.

## Register Your Server
The workshop server should become aware of your web server. Each starter kit has
an automated way to register itself. See the README in your starter kit how the
specific registration works.

## Teach Your Boids
This is were you are able to shine. Teach your boids in anyway you see fit. The
chapter about the brain will point you in the right direction.

## Run The Server
Running your server allows your boids to roam free in their habitat and follow
the path you thought them to follow.
