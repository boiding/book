# What to expect
This book is used during the _Boiding_ workshop. It allows you explore to
[Craig Reynold's](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/) _boids_ that simulate flocking
behavior of animals such as fish and birds.

But this is not a passive workshop! You get to explore the simulation by
building it! We provide you with the background to understand the algorithm and
a platform to explore the algorithm.

You will be implementing the brain of your own species of boids and seeing them
flock on the big screen.
