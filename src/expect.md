# What to expect
This book is used during the _Boiding_ workshop. It allows you to explore
[Craig Reynold's](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/) _boids_ that simulate flocking
behavior of animals such as fish and birds.

But this is not a passive workshop! You get to explore the simulation by
building it! We provide you with the background to understand the algorithm and
a platform to explore it.

You will be implementing the brain of your own species of boids and see them
flock on the big screen.

## Outline
Below we give an outline of the chapters to come.

In the background chapter we will illustrate the key ideas of Craig Reynolds algorithm.
This is a mathematical description of the behavior of the boids.

The plan chapter provides an overview of the workshop. What your role as a participant is,
what you can expect of the platform you will be communicating with, and tips and tricks how
to have the most fun.

The last two chapters are divided between the web server you will be creating and how you
can implement the web server to act as the brain of your boids.
